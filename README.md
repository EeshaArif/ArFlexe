# ArFlexe
#### Introduction:
ARFlexe is an Android Application showcasing the use of Augmented Reality in the Furniture and Education Industry. 
It is built using Google's [ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar) and Sceneform sdk. 
###### Usecases:
ArFlexe is a demo that demonstrates the use of Augmented Reality in the following three useases:

1. Business (Furniture Industry)
2. Education (Engineering Drawing)
3. Medical (Human Anatomy)
#### Business Industry:

The main **problem** when it comes to buying furniture is that the customers do not know how the furniture would look or feel like in their own home and setting. They can make assumptions but due to lack of real visualization, the customers end up being dissatisfied after buying the product. In any commercial business, customer satisfaction is crucial.

To enhance customer experience, This application has the capability of detecting surfaces and letting the users visualize furniture, move it around, resize it in their own homes ahead of purchase using Augmented Reality. This functionality is similar to [Ikea Place](https://www.ikea.com/au/en/customer-service/mobile-apps/say-hej-to-ikea-place-pub1f8af050).

For further explanation on how this was done. Take a look at [Scene-Viewer](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/scene-viewer).
#### Education Industry:
To help students in engineering field to better visualize the 2D views in 3D modeling.
ArFlexe renders the 3D Models of the side-views given. 

It scans the image and provides the model accordingly.

To better understand this code, check the official documentation of [Augmented Images](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/augmented-images).

#### Medical Industry:
A skeleton is rendered in real space alongside a detailed list of its parts.
#### Execution:
To run this application on your android device, you must install [	
Google Play Services for AR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core&hl=en). Also ensure that your device is on the list of [compatible devices](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices).
